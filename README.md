# Home Manager
This is a Raspberry Pi based Home Automation Manager. Utilises mosquitto, Homebridge, Homebridge-mqtt and Domoticz and the projects contained in my other GitHub repositories to automate airconditioning, doorbell, lighting, power outlets, flood sensors, door sensors, window blinds and a garage door opener. The fucntional overiews are contained in a separate folder.

I'm undertaking a major exercise in code refactoring and will post the code when that's finished.
