# Home Manager
This is a Raspberry Pi based Home Automation Manager. Utilises mosquitto, Homebridge, Homebridge-mqtt, Domoticz and the projects contained in my other GitHub repositories to automate airconditioning, doorbell, lighting, power outlets, flood sensors, door sensors, window blinds and a garage door opener. The functional overviews are contained in a separate folder.

The first release of the OOP code version is now posted.
